A real-time AI-powered SQL activity dashboard that detects database changes, explains them using local Llama AI, and alerts you about anomalies — all free and open-source.



📌 Project: AI-Powered Real-Time SQL Change Analyzer Dashboard
📖 Overview

I want to build a real-time SQL activity monitoring dashboard that automatically:

detects inserts, updates, deletes happening inside any MySQL database

highlights changes visually in a dashboard

explains changes using AI (free, local model like Llama 3 in Ollama)

identifies anomalies, strange patterns, or suspicious updates

acts like a “smart DB inspector” for developers and teams

It should work like a mini real-time SQL Copilot, fully open-source, free to use, and anyone should be able to connect their own MySQL database easily.

🧩 Core Idea

The system listens to binlog events in MySQL (binary log), which contain:

what changed

which table

before/after values

timestamp

These change events are streamed into the UI using WebSockets.

AI analyzes each change and produces:

human-friendly explanations

anomaly detection

“what might have caused this?” suggestions

“is this risky?” classification

⚙️ Tech Stack (All Free)
Frontend

React + TypeScript + Vite

TailwindCSS

WebSockets (live updates)

Zustand or Redux for state

Recharts / Chart.js for analytics

A clean reusable UI components system

Backend

Node.js + Express

mysql2 or mysql-binlog listener

WebSocket server (ws or socket.io)

AI Engine: Ollama (Llama 3 local model) — free

Config storage: JSON file (user-saved DB credentials)

Database

Any MySQL instance (user chooses)

User enters credentials through a UI settings page

No database access from frontend — backend only.

🔒 Why Backend Connection Is Required

Frontend cannot connect to SQL directly.

So:
Frontend → Backend → User MySQL

The dashboard will allow the user to input:

host

port

user

password

database

Backend dynamically connects and restarts binlog listener.

🧠 AI Logic

When the backend receives a binlog event:

Convert raw event into a structured JSON diff:

table name

action type

old values

new values

timestamp

Send the data into Llama 3 (via Ollama):

“Explain this change”

“Is this normal?”

“What might this mean?”

“Is this an anomaly?”

Return AI explanation to frontend.

🚀 How the Dashboard Works
1. User connects their database

They open Settings → Database Configuration and enter details.

Backend saves config and reconnects automatically.

2. Backend starts MySQL binlog listener

It listens to:

INSERT

UPDATE

DELETE

Metadata changes

Every event is processed immediately.

3. Backend streams changes to frontend

Using WebSockets:

{ 
  type: "UPDATE",
  table: "users",
  before: { name: "John" },
  after: { name: "Johnny" },
  at: "2025-01-15T10:22:31"
}

4. AI analyzes each change

Local model explains the update in simple language:

"The user 'John' updated their name to 'Johnny'. 
Likely a user profile change. Not suspicious."


Or

"3000 rows deleted from 'orders'. 
Unusual operation. Possibly bulk cleanup or accidental query."

5. Frontend displays the event

UI shows:

highlighted updated row

animation for new events

AI insights in a side panel

timeline of changes

table-specific activity

6. Dashboard Features
✔ Real-Time Activity Stream

Sidebar showing all events streaming live.

✔ Table Activity Heatmap

Which table is being modified most?

✔ AI Explanations

Local Llama explains each event.

✔ Anomaly Alerts

AI marks unusual queries:

too many deletes

SQL pattern anomalies

high-frequency writes

repeated updates in same table

✔ Timeline Viz

A visual timeline of changes.

✔ Diff Viewer UI

Compare before/after values in a pretty diff format.
